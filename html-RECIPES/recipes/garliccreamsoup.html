            <li>4-8 oz pancetta, diced</li>
            <li>1 small onion, chopped</li>
            <li>4 cups chicken stock</li>
            <li>1/2 cup parmesan cheese, grated</li>
            <li>2 cups kale, ribs removed, shredded</li>
            <li>1 cup heavy cream</li>
            <li>1/2 tsp </li>
            <li>1/2 tsp pepper</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps:</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>
                Preheat oven to 180C.
            </li>
            <li>
                Trim the tops off 4 of the heads of garlic. Just enough to expose all its cloves. Pour 1/2 tablespoon olive oil over the exposed cloves and sprinkle with a little salt and pepper. Place each bulb right side up on a small square of foil. Fold the foil around the bulb of garlic and place on a cookie sheet. Roast the garlic for 45 minutes. Cool thoroughly. 
            </li>
            <li>
                In a large pot, cook diced pancetta over medium heat until crispy, about 5-7 minutes. Drain off all but 1 tablespoon of pancetta fat. Reserve crispy pancetta in bowl. Add chopped onion to pancetta drippings in pan. Sauté onions until they start to caramelize, about 10 minutes.
            </li>
            <li>
                When roasted garlic is cooled, press it out of its skins. Add it to a blender along with the chicken stock and cooked onions. Purée the soup until smooth. 
            </li>
            <li>
                Return soup to the pot, add kale and parmesan and bring to a simmer until kale is tender. Add cream and heat until desired temperature. Sprinkle the pancetta evenly among bowls and serve.
