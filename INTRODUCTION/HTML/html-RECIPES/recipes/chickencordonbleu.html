            <h2>Description:</h2>
            <p>
                A cordon bleu or schnitzel cordon bleu is a dish of meat wrapped around cheese (or with cheese filling), then breaded and pan-fried or deep-fried. Veal or pork cordon bleu is made of veal or pork pounded thin and wrapped around a slice of ham and a slice of cheese, breaded, and then pan-fried or baked. For chicken cordon bleu, chicken breast is used instead of veal. Ham cordon bleu is ham stuffed with mushrooms and cheese.

            <h2>Steps:</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>
                    Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Coat a 7x11-inch baking dish with nonstick cooking spray. 
                </li>
                <li>
                    Pound chicken breasts to 1/4 inch thickness. 
                </li>
                <li>
                    Sprinkle each piece of chicken on both sides with salt and pepper. Place 1 Swiss cheese slice and 1 ham slice on top of each breast. 
                </li>
                <li>
                    Roll up each breast and secure with toothpicks.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Place in the prepared baking dish and sprinkle chicken evenly with bread crumbs. 
                </li>
                <li>
                    Bake in the preheated oven until chicken is no longer pink, 30 to 35 minutes.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Remove from the oven, and place 1/2 Swiss cheese slice on top of each breast.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Return to the oven until cheese has melted, 3 to 5 minutes. Remove toothpicks and serve immediately. 
                </li>
